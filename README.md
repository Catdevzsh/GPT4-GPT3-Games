# GPT4-GPT3-Games

Welcome to the GPT4-GPT3-Games repository! This project is dedicated to exploring and demonstrating the capabilities of Generative Pre-trained Transformers, specifically GPT-3 and GPT-4, in the creation and enhancement of video games. Here, you'll find various game prototypes, tools, and resources that utilize these AI models to deliver unique gaming experiences.

## About the Project

This repository serves as a hub for projects that integrate GPT-3 and GPT-4 into gaming environments. The goal is to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI in games, whether it's through narrative generation, dynamic content creation, or intelligent NPC behavior.

## Featured Projects

- **AI Dungeon Master**: A text-based adventure game where GPT-4 generates quests, worlds, and characters on the fly.
- **NPC Dialogue Enhancer**: A tool that uses GPT-3 to create realistic and engaging dialogues for NPCs in existing games.
- **Dynamic Plot Generator**: Leverages GPT-4 to dynamically alter game storylines based on player choices.
